## 📡 REST API Endpoints (Mocked via MirageJS)

| Method | Endpoint        | Description         |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------- |
| GET    | /api/songs      | Fetch all songs     |
| GET    | /api/songs/:id  | Fetch a single song |
| POST   | /api/songs      | Add a new song      |
| PUT    | /api/songs/:id  | Update a song       |
| DELETE | /api/songs/:id  | Delete a song       |

⚠️ **Note**: All endpoints are mocked using MirageJS (see `src/mirage/server.js`)

## ⚙️ Webpack Configuration

This project uses a **custom Webpack config** (not CRA) for full control.

🧩 Key Features:

* Babel for JSX + TypeScript
* CSS + image loaders
* dotenv-webpack for env variables
* HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
* Code splitting with lazy loading
* Production optimization via **TerserPlugin**

✅ **Verified**:

* `npm start` runs the app
* Live reload works
* `npm run build` creates production build
* `dist/index.html` works independently
* Bundle inspected for correct asset loading

## 🤖 AI Usage & Code Verification

✅ **Tools Used**:

* ChatGPT & GitHub Copilot for:

  * Generating boilerplate (Redux setup, Webpack configuration)
  * Regex, filtering logic
  * Debug help & refactoring

🧠 **My Work**:

* Read, understood, and **modified every AI-assisted code**
* Manually tested in browser
* Used React DevTools + `console.log` for debugging
* Wrote unit tests for components & reducers

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

📁 Location: `src/__tests__/components/`

🧬 Covers:

* ✅ Rendering
* ✅ User interactions (input, clicks)
* ✅ Redux logic

🧪 Run:

```bash
npm test
```

🛠 Verified with:

* Manual browser tests
* API mocking check (MirageJS)
* Redux DevTools to confirm state flow
